Hello professor, Basnet I am aware of the lack of work and messiness of my attempts, and I wanted to apologize. This has been a really rough semester for me, but it is not an excuse for the lack of work I am missing on my final as well as I put in over the semester. If I can get an extension on the final, I know I will make my work and attempts much better as well as accomplish more than just one Kattis problem. I am not expecting an extension and completely understand if I am not granted one and will take whatever grade I get with no questions asked. I did really enjoy your class and once again apologize for my lack of work. I liked your teaching, and I did learn a lot from you and hope I can learn even more in the future. Thank you for the semester. (This message is also the email I sent you)
